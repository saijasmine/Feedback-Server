Description :

 The Student Feedback System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of collecting 

student feedback in educational institutions. It offers a secure interface for students to provide feedback on college 

departments, replacing traditional paper methods. Students log in with unique credentials to evaluate faculty 

performance through a detailed questionnaire. Faculty can review their feedback via a secure login, and admins 

manage data updates and communication. This system enhances efficiency, confidentiality, and continuous 

improvement in faculty evaluation and professional development.
